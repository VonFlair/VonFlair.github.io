Last updated: June 16, 2025

Thank you for using Colab Code Copier. Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and why.

Data Collection
Colab Code Copier is designed with privacy as a core principle.

We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user data.

Permissions
The extension requires minimal permissions to function:

activeTab & scripting: To run the copying script on the currently open Colab page when you click the extension's icon.
host permission for colab.research.google.com: To ensure the script can only run on Google Colab websites.
